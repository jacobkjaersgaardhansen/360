# View live 360 video stream on a smartphone
The aim of this project is to be able to watch a <b>live</b> 360 video stream on a smartphone. The project is inspired by the <b>recorded</b> 360 videos that lately have shown up on Facebook and Youtube (like http://youtu.be/7gjR60TSn8Q). Such videos these give the viewer an immersive experience of being there himself by utilizing the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer (that most new smartphones have) to change the direction of view just by moving the smartphone.

We want to achieve the same kind of "being-there" experience with live video. We acknowledge that real 3D 360 view takes a lot of computation power, but we have seen that 2D 360 live conference calls are possible in real time with commercial available equipment like the device seen on the table in center of this picture http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzAyLzA0LzFlL3BvbHljb21yb29tLjE5MjE4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/99230cc9/c2a/polycom-room-system.jpg and we believe that a lightweight 2D solution is possible. 

We want to put a live video stream from such a device into a webpage and "navigate" around the stream by using dynamically cropping of the stream. I.e. say at every 50 ms the device orientation is measured locally and the video stream is cropped accordingly. The device orientation can be determined with javascript using the classes OnDeviceMotion (for accelerometer data) and OnDeviceOrientation (for the gyroscope).
