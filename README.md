# View live 360 videostream on a smartphone
The aim of this project is to be able to watch a <b>live</b> 360 videostream on a smartphone. The project is inspired by the <b>recorded</b> 360 videostreams that lately have shown up on Facebook and Youtube (like youtu.be/7gjR60TSn8Q). Such videos these give the viewer an immersive experience of being there himself by utilizing the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer (that most new smartphones have) to change the direction of view just by moving the smartphone.
